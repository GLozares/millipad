## A First Step into the World of Keyboards
Hi there! If you're reading this, thank you for stopping by. This is a repository detailing my first foray into custom mechanical keyboards. I decided to make a custom mechanical keypad to use for myself as my favorite keyboard layout, the 65%, does not have F1 through F12. However, in some circumstances particularly when I am coding, I would like to have those function keys. Thus, instead of buying a numpad off the shelf, I thought it was a great opportunity to make my own.

Prior to this project, I took on a group project in my Computer Engineering senior design class that involves creating our own full sized custom mechanical keyboard. I took some initiative and began to learn PCB design myself as to be a bigger asset to my group down the line.

## Credits
Apart from the dependant repositories already linked in my project, I would like to thank ai03 for their beginner's tutorial on keyboard PCB design. Their guide can be found at https://wiki.ai03.com/books/pcb-design.
